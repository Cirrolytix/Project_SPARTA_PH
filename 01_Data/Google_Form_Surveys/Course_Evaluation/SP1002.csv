First, the language usage could be more uniform to make it easier to digest.

There are many instances throughout this course where a term has been used once and then another term has been used to reflect the same term which is totally unnecessary and makes the course more confusing. 

I believe having access to the data being used on the samples would definitely make this a lot more interactive.

It is a vital tool in operations management such that it impacts all business functions and operations decisions. Forecasting is mostly used  in predictive analytics.

Forecasts are rarely perfect and forecasting involves uncertainty. It may be hard perfect but the goal is to keep forecast errors as low as possible to arrive at close to perfect figures. Forecasts are more accurate for shorter than longer time horizons. Shorter time horizon may mean a lower degree of uncertainty because data variations are minimal for data with short coverage.","Before the course I just know the basic of analytics .The topic is very interesting and it helps me understand things that were always there and I keep on doing/using in my line of work but I don't know why this things are effective.
