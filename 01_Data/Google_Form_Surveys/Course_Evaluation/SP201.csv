Start with basic like the interface and terms. The samples  in the course were random and not related. Just like in the capstone project, should have one final output that started with basic data and shows progress as more through the course and apply the advanced functions. There are also too many functions introduced but lack of in-depth explanation on how to manipulate it together with other functions. Assessment can also be improved. There are several questions that focused on knowledge on terminologies and definition (even some ""tricky"" questions that uses word play) rather than application. I took an excel quiz on other platforms before and what they do is provide a file and questions are based there and how we use the functions like - determine the median of the given set or what is the value is cell b17 if you sort this column a in descending order. I think this method will measure the student's capability to use Excel better. Even the capstone project is not focused on measuring Excel skill.","SP201.csv"

Additionally, I find the excel survey activity not necessary at all. I find it too time-consuming to reach 50 respondents which is time spent not even on the excel technicalities (just persuading people to answer). There are already many datasets out there that could serve as an alternative so that students can focus on the excel functions itself. I find it more efficient this way","SP201.csv"

Rather than just showing students how to format these correctly, present more examples / use cases, as well as (when applicable) how to interpret formula/function results correctly.

For example, the section on statistical functions presents information on functions like STDEV and VAR. But some students may be coming into the course with no knowledge of when it's appropriate to use these functions, as well as what the resulting values from these functions might mean.

The course's focus on the mechanics of using Excel also isn't particularly beneficial for students who may already be familiar with Excel. The course materials hinge too much on particulars of layout (e.g., instructions to click on particular icons in a section of the command ribbon), which may be tedious for students who are already coming in with knowledge of certain keyboard shortcuts, for example. This kind of particularity also isn't always helpful for beginners, as layout details, etc. may differ across different versions of Excel, leading to confusion for beginners who may not have exactly the same layout as what's described in the course (e.g., Mac users, or those with older versions of Excel).

All in all, the course could be enhanced in two major ways:
1. Adding more context to the tools being taught, so that students learn not just how to use these but when, why, and how best to do so.
2. Rethinking the presentation of the course or finding a way to calibrate the material better to serve varying skill levels. (Some options to consider would be: allowing intermediate students to skip earlier sections after passing some kind of assessment; retooling the module quizzes to not depend so heavily on little details that may not be the same across different versions of Excel; etc.) ","SP201.csv"

Maybe I just challenge the question after lessons. I watch and also practice what's in the lessons but some topics are not explained well. There's always a question in my mind that's why I search for other videos about that topic. I think it's not new videos It's time to change it. or maybe I was wrong but overall it's neutral for me.","explained it well. In the video, it has silence times meaning he just does what he thinks he needs to do. But for me as a new learner of excel, it's hard for me to move along. I can't remember one lesson that I watch the video many times to know how he gets that in the end, I search for it. I wish while he was moving his mouse he will explain what was in his data. This is just my opinion about the lesson as a beginner. Thank You","SP201.csv"
