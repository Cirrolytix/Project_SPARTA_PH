First, the language usage could be more uniform to make it easier to digest.

There are many instances throughout this course where a term has been used once and then another term has been used to reflect the same term which is totally unnecessary and makes the course more confusing. 

I believe having access to the data being used on the samples would definitely make this a lot more interactive.

It is a vital tool in operations management such that it impacts all business functions and operations decisions. Forecasting is mostly used  in predictive analytics.

Forecasts are rarely perfect and forecasting involves uncertainty. It may be hard perfect but the goal is to keep forecast errors as low as possible to arrive at close to perfect figures. Forecasts are more accurate for shorter than longer time horizons. Shorter time horizon may mean a lower degree of uncertainty because data variations are minimal for data with short coverage.","Before the course I just know the basic of analytics .The topic is very interesting and it helps me understand things that were always there and I keep on doing/using in my line of work but I don't know why this things are effective.

Time series forecasting means to forecast or to predict the future value over a period of time. It entails developing models based on previous data and applying them to make observations and guide future strategic decisions. It?s not always an exact prediction, and likelihood of forecasts can vary wildly?especially when dealing with the commonly fluctuating variables in time series data as well as factors outside our control. With the insights gained  from forecasted data, we may be able to use them to make observations and drive future strategic decision-making to be able to achieve organizations goals.","I can't think of anything to enhance the delivery of the course since it is already informative and I like the weekly exercises/exam where we can apply what we have learned so far.","SP1003.csv"

These happened to completely different courses but I feel like it applies to any course.

An example is, avoid using screenshots when asking students to compute something in excel, just give them a spreadsheet, not let them encode it all manually. Less prone to errors that way. (this was observed in a final exam). 

Or if the course lacks graded evaluations and has the final capstone as their only form of official evaluation, maybe not make it something so subjective as peer evaluation and lean towards a more objective way of evaluation.  ","SP1006.csv"

It is important in managing public finances of the economy. PFM encompasses the seven areas budgeting, accounting, auditing, revenue generation, cash management, debt management and public reporting on public sector financial operations. The elements of Good and Effective budgeting are; Aggregate fiscal discipline or spending within means, it is controlling the level of spending. Allocative efficiency or spending on the right priorities, it is spending on the right things and setting priorities straight. Technical efficiency or spending with measurable results, is spending at the right cost and producing more with less cost. Budget Preparation input requires budget call and budget priorities, the process are formulation of FEs, citizen engagement, program convergence budgeting, tier 2 agency proposal, budget hearings and review, presentation to the president and consolidation, validation, confirmation. The output should be the President's Budget. Budget Legislation input requires the President's budget. The process are home deliberations, senate deliberations, bicameral deliberations, ratification and enrolment, and enactment. The output of this is the General Appropriations Acts (GAA) or the People's budget. Budget execution includes, early procurement activities, budget programming, allotment release, obligation, issuance of notice of cash allocation and disbursement. The implementation are being monitored and evaluated during budget accountability. It includes performance targets, accountability reports, public disclosures, performance review, publication of mid-year and year-end reports and audit.

In week 2, I learned that budget allocations are further classified as to sector, expense class, regions, recipient unit, special purpose funds, and appropriation source. The allocation of the national government budget for major sector includes social services, economic services, general public services, debt burden and defense. Budget dimensions by expense class includes Personnel services(PS), maintenance and other operating expenses (MOOE), capital outlays (CO), and financial expenditures (FinEx). I also learned that budget can also be classified according to the appropriation source.

In week 3, I learned about the sources of the government?s revenues ? tax and non-tax revenues. The major classes of tax revenue are taxes on income and profits, taxes on property, taxes on domestic goods and services, taxes on international trade and transactions and other sources. Non tax revenues are Bureau of the treasury (BTr) income, privatization, fees and charges, and other sources. Other sources of revenue are income tax, estate and donor's taxes, value added tax, other percentage taxes, excise taxes, documentary stamp taxes and other taxes. Reforming the tax system is important for it promotes investment, create jobs and reduce poverty. Some features of the CTRP are TRAIN Law, tax amnesty, sin taxes. 
 
In week 4, I learned the importance of government borrowings and debt service. Government borrows money to spend on the welfare of their people, to   support services programs and projects. Especially when the country facing a challenge like this pandemic, it is important to meet the needs of the people for their safety and security. To finance national government deficits, to obtain foreign exchange, to secure financing at more favorable terms than the opportunity cost of revenues, to take advantage of benefits attached to the funds and to balance the timing of resources with the project gestation and repayment of benefit.

MAYBE the team can review if a support staff or SME should probably interact in the discussion forum, especially in the case studies (just like in other courses) because I observed that learners tend to have different understanding of how questions are answered. Since this is the case, even if I participate in answering the case studies, I am not sure if my understanding of the cases were correct or not because there is no feedback or follow up to elaborate in the next section--just week summary. :-)","SP1007.csv"

To provide information to the citizens, Government websites with information on policies and programs, laws and regulations, budgets, and other issues of public interest. This aims to quickly and easily provide access to information and services to individuals. 
Consultation. This is where the Governments offer online consultation mechanism and tools, which present citizens with choices about public policy topics and encouragement to contribute. This helps the government to improve its  citizen-centered decision and policy-making.
Participation. This intends the Government to incorporate citizens into decision-making processes, generally through participatory budgeting. They provide online participation platforms where citizens can propose, discuss, give feedback, and vote for initiatives aimed to solve or improve a wide range of situations and problems in different aspects of a city.

1. Definition of terms of some technical word used in the course.
2.Compilation of images used in the video. Some images have small font size and color gray similar to color of background of slide which make it difficult to read even in full screen mode.
 3. It will be helpful to cite some practical example of the end-data product to have better understanding of the concept. ( ex. predictive service)
4. I suggest that course is recommended to take after course with basic coding. SP102 as code after SP101 is quite confusing. The course is more technical in approach which overwhelm me in technicalities in coding. It might be better has has higher SP code maybe after basic python.
5. I hope there is alternative software to use to do the exit assessment other than GCP (PS: when in rate the course I'm still waiting for the reply in my question, maybe in future there will be answer in this suggestion.)

I have finished five courses here in Project SPARTA and I am very thankful for all the hard work of your team. Unfortunately, this course has a lot of issues. 

First, the lecture videos are lacking in detail. If the audience are expected to be beginners in data science, the speed and depth in which the topics will be handled should consider this. The lecture videos jump from topic to topic without a clear discussion of the lesson. Steps were quickly listed without any step-by-step guidance. Considering that we are learning a new service (i.e. GCP), the material should?ve been more friendly to those without a background on this. Even if you carefully follow the provided steps, it would lead to an error in GCP because of the lack of clarity in the lecture video. Although one might argue that we should do our own self-study outside of the course, the counterargument is that there should be at least some guidance on extra resources or a screen recording on how to do it. For example, my experience in SP201 and SP401 was helpful since I was shown either a screen recording of how to do the excel functions or a Youtube video on how to do the corporate dashboard report. With a complex service such as GCP, it is more so expected that the course will have a detailed guide. 

Second, the assessment had problems with validity. Besides the problems with the answer key, it wasn?t helpful in assessing the learning objectives. In my other courses (e.g. SP201, SP401, SP501), the assessment really tested our skills through a task that prompted us to apply our learning. I really appreciated those assignments, despite the difficulty, because I knew that I was really honing a skill that I can bring back to my work and research. Unfortunately, in this case, it appears that the assessment was given for the sake of having an assessment. 

Lastly, I noticed that the content of the video and the assessment needs updating. Comparing the GCP content in the video and the current GCP content on the web, there are differences that should also be reflected in the assessment. 
I am interested in learning about data science. I spend my weekends studying and doing my tasks because I see value in this government initiative. Unfortunately, one can?t help but be saddened if the potential of the course is wasted on poorly prepared materials. ","SP102.csv"

It allowed me to feel that I am not the only one who is struggling with this course. I started this course 2 months ago and I am still not yet done with the Week 4 Assessment because it is very hard. ","Some suggestions:
1. Base the exit assessments on the discussions because some questions were not even discussed and we need to research about it instead of learning from the SME. New words just pop up in some assessments.
2. When discussing about codes, it is better to have a screen recording and walking us through every step than just merely saying what is in the screenshot in the slides.
3. Provide a code resource after each coding session because most of the screenshots were blurred and cannot be read.
4. A live session regarding this course would be nice but it wasn't offered so I am still stuck in this course.
5. An alternative exit assessment for the coding assessments would be great.","SP102.csv"

Start with basic like the interface and terms. The samples  in the course were random and not related. Just like in the capstone project, should have one final output that started with basic data and shows progress as more through the course and apply the advanced functions. There are also too many functions introduced but lack of in-depth explanation on how to manipulate it together with other functions. Assessment can also be improved. There are several questions that focused on knowledge on terminologies and definition (even some ""tricky"" questions that uses word play) rather than application. I took an excel quiz on other platforms before and what they do is provide a file and questions are based there and how we use the functions like - determine the median of the given set or what is the value is cell b17 if you sort this column a in descending order.

Additionally, I find the excel survey activity not necessary at all. I find it too time-consuming to reach 50 respondents which is time spent not even on the excel technicalities (just persuading people to answer). There are already many datasets out there that could serve as an alternative so that students can focus on the excel functions itself. I find it more efficient this way","SP201.csv"

Rather than just showing students how to format these correctly, present more examples / use cases, as well as (when applicable) how to interpret formula/function results correctly.

For example, the section on statistical functions presents information on functions like STDEV and VAR. But some students may be coming into the course with no knowledge of when it's appropriate to use these functions, as well as what the resulting values from these functions might mean.

The course's focus on the mechanics of using Excel also isn't particularly beneficial for students who may already be familiar with Excel. The course materials hinge too much on particulars of layout (e.g., instructions to click on particular icons in a section of the command ribbon), which may be tedious for students who are already coming in with knowledge of certain keyboard shortcuts, for example. This kind of particularity also isn't always helpful for beginners, as layout details, etc. may differ across different versions of Excel, leading to confusion for beginners who may not have exactly the same layout as what's described in the course (e.g., Mac users, or those with older versions of Excel).

All in all, the course could be enhanced in two major ways:
1. Adding more context to the tools being taught, so that students learn not just how to use these but when, why, and how best to do so.
2. Rethinking the presentation of the course or finding a way to calibrate the material better to serve varying skill levels. (Some options to consider would be: allowing intermediate students to skip earlier sections after passing some kind of assessment; retooling the module quizzes to not depend so heavily on little details that may not be the same across different versions of Excel; etc.) ","SP201.csv"

Compare this with the assessment questions that properly lays down the context of the question.

2. Use the laser pointer when showing a slide with lots of information. Many of the slides are rich in information. The down-side to this is that when the speaker starts talking about a part of the slide, the listener can easily get lost trying to find the item the speaker is talking about.

I am a teacher and my school has recently implemented a plan on how to manage and protect the school's data collection. Based on the series of discussion with all the members of the school, they have come up with a plan and series of processes on paper about how to handle school data. And as anybody's guess, it was the IT section of the school that was chosen to head the data management plan. From what I remember about the open consultation, the head and even the upper school management have really no robust idea of what data management is and how to go about it. I believe they were just trying to come up with a data management plan because the Data Privacy Act and Anti-Cyber Crime Law demands it. I can only think of a host of problems and issues arising from this scenario. Hopefully, my knowledge from this course and the subsequent courses about data management in SPARTA would allow me shed some light and provide significant help on this matter. Because, learning and finishing the course is already rewarding overall.","Kindly improve the color. A lighter background in the video is more palatable than a dark background because it keeps me awake. Or are the videos just really dreary? If so, please improve the video quality or color and how information is presented. Also, kindly improve the review/recall questions. It's great that the review/recall questions are provided and gamified after every learning section but all or most of them are knowledge questions. I think they can still be improved.","SP301.csv"

Topic is theoretical and, therefore, difficult. 

PPTs, tables, graphs, and other visual aids should make the lecture lighter to avoid the monotony of lists and discussions, making them more memorable.

The End Quizzes are also not working in a way because almost all items include None of the Above and tend to be confusing. To reinforce learning, the correct answers should be the ones highlighted, the questions need to be formulated positively, and perhaps not as lists requiring multiple answers.

In fact, this course is the worst course I've taken in my entire life. The speakers are just reading what was in the slide and no further information was given. I suggest you just gave the learners a handout or something and we will read it on our own. This course will never fail to disappoint learners, especially those who don't have background in Statistics. ","1) We will appreciate it more if this course have better visual aids. I mean, yes there is a part in the lecture which narrates how to do ANOVA in Excel. My question is, why narrate it if you can demonstrate (via video) how to do it? Also, images and plots are so small and blurred that axes labels are almost unreadable.

2) Maybe you can elaborate more on other topics. We've seen a lot of plots, but it was not discussed how to construct them and how to use them. In this course, they are given to learners as constructed plots, without teaching the learners how to construct them, and most importantly, how to interpret them. For example, how do we know when to say that a residual plot is ""well-behaved?"" I'm not well-versed in Statistics so the ""well-behaved"" and ""not well-behaved"" residual plots both looks chaotic to me. Maybe you should have given us some pointers or guidelines how to interpret these graphs?

3) I truly believe that the guest speakers of this course are knowledgeable in Statistics. I hope they will use their knowledge in demonstrating examples (real world examples) instead of just reading what was written in the slides. I actually finished some video presentation WITHOUT playing the video. I just read the transcript on the side because THE CONTENT OF THE VIDEO AND THE TRANSCRIPT ARE THE SAME. Sometimes illustrations/graphs are provided but due to the quality of the illustration, ITS ALMOST USELESS.

4) I hope the team will create a prerequisite for this course maybe? I think this is the first course in Statistical Analysis here  but Oh boy, the lectures looked like it treated us like learners with Master's degree in Statistics, continuously giving out technical words which I heard here for the first time in my entire life, and no explanation or whatsoever was given to even define what does those technical statistical terms mean.","SP602.csv"

Understanding the concept and purpose of Experimental Design. Experimental design  means creating a set of procedures to test a hypothesis and laying out a detailed experimental plan in advance of doing the experiment to obtain data that can be analyze to yield valid and objective conclusions. It is the most familiar type of research design in the field of science and some other fields and industries. A well-chosen experimental designs can maximize the amount of information that can be obtain for a given amount of experimental effort.","Lesson is great and delivery, for me is already enhanced. For the calculation part, I think its best to provide a handout to the students for practice and easy understanding. ","SP602.csv"

2. When talking about using Excel, the dataset can be provided to us so that we can follow while the SMEs are discussing. Also, demonstration is better than just telling what to do and what was done.
3. More of graphs and less of text so that we can understand it more because too much texts in a slide lowers the excitement to learn.
4. Better if the SMEs can be seen while discussing. There are some parts in the presentation that has low volume and the exponents are not properly written.

> If possible, coordinate with coursebank so a local IDE or coding environment is used in quizzes instead of peer-graded assignments (like in Hackerrank, Kaggle, GeeksforGeeks, etc.).

-Descriptive Analytics in Excel pt. 9: Values for age percentiles were different for the 2nd table and the table for array processing. It might help to explain that the values in the array processing tables were the ""lower bounds"" and they were captured and utilized instead of what was in the 2nd table to facilitate the use of the MATCH function in the 1st table - that if the actual percentile values, as in the 2nd table, were used, the group tag column would show some error considering the nature of the MATCH function.

1. Topics. Although I had previous machine learning courses before, personally, I am still challenged with following the discussion per video. The topics seem to be compressed into couple of videos and they are highly technical, with less application/demonstration in Python. 

2. Library. The course used mglearn package a lot. mglearn is a helper package that is used for the book ""Introduction to Machine Learning with Python"". I don't think that this is practical because I think we would be using mostly sklearn in field. Although it's helpful in the sense of discussing the concepts, but I think we should have focused on using sklearn.

3. Applicability. As mentioned in item 1, many topics are highly technical. This is okay, but we should have had a live demo (similar to Data Engineering using SQL), and focusing on sklearn. This is would boost further confidence on coding in Python. I codes were presented without going through the steps, which would really be challenging, especially, the library which was highly used is not a common package. I think that we should have built the habit for the learners to rely on sklearn.","SP901.csv"

- Please have a pre-requisite before taking the course. I'm an advanced beginner in coding (python) and haven't done machine learning before. So i was excited about this course as i thought it will guide me. Unfortunately, this is for mid to advanced skilled students not for beginners. I'm very disappointed that it's not really well explained (compared to the previous class I took). It almost discourage me from completing the course - but i need to cos I'm a Sparta scholar. 
- I know machine learning is difficult. I hope the team behind this course consult a beginner (or someone with 0 idea about machine learning) so they were able to make appropriate content that is for beginner. It's always possible to divide this course into two if one course isn't enough to fully grasp the topic.

Overall, this is not for beginner. ","SP901.csv"

It took around 4-6 weeks to get a grade for each assessment, even as I attempted to give the maximum possible number of assessments (around 12-16) to try and reduce the peer grading backlog. Please consider opening assessments so that students can proceed to the next week's assessment without having to wait for a grade from their previous week's assessment.

Video lectures are difficult to understand, especially for beginners. Most videos seem to be inadequate summaries of corresponding sections of the ""Deep Learning with Python"" by Fran?ois Chollet and are extremely difficult to learn from without consulting the source material. The videos should be recreated with more thorough explanation.

Assessments also involve only slight tweaks to the sample codes presented in lecture, so perhaps it would be better to include prompts that encourage exploration (e.g. have students try to identify why particular metrics change when varying specific hyperparameters).","SP902.csv"
