It might help to explain that the values in the array processing tables were the ""lower bounds"" and they were captured and utilized instead of what was in the 2nd table to facilitate the use of the MATCH function in the 1st table - that if the actual percentile values, as in the 2nd table, were used, the group tag column would show some error considering the nature of the MATCH function.
