I am a teacher and my school has recently implemented a plan on how to manage and protect the school's data collection. Based on the series of discussion with all the members of the school, they have come up with a plan and series of processes on paper about how to handle school data. And as anybody's guess, it was the IT section of the school that was chosen to head the data management plan. From what I remember about the open consultation, the head and even the upper school management have really no robust idea of what data management is and how to go about it. I believe they were just trying to come up with a data management plan because the Data Privacy Act and Anti-Cyber Crime Law demands it. I can only think of a host of problems and issues arising from this scenario. Hopefully, my knowledge from this course and the subsequent courses about data management in SPARTA would allow me shed some light and provide significant help on this matter. Because, learning and finishing the course is already rewarding overall.","Kindly improve the color. A lighter background in the video is more palatable than a dark background because it keeps me awake. Or are the videos just really dreary? If so, please improve the video quality or color and how information is presented. Also, kindly improve the review/recall questions. It's great that the review/recall questions are provided and gamified after every learning section but all or most of them are knowledge questions. I think they can still be improved.","SP301.csv"

The most rewarding parts are the lessons that list  the scope, rules, requirements, tools, and metrics since they're very informative and came as lists?although only from my Notes because even the lists are in lecture form, which are harder to digest and visualize.","More presentations to digest the longish lectures, that led me to simply reading the transcript instead of listening and taking down notes at the same time to understand what's being said. 

Topic is theoretical and, therefore, difficult. 

PPTs, tables, graphs, and other visual aids should make the lecture lighter to avoid the monotony of lists and discussions, making them more memorable.

The End Quizzes are also not working in a way because almost all items include None of the Above and tend to be confusing. To reinforce learning, the correct answers should be the ones highlighted, the questions need to be formulated positively, and perhaps not as lists requiring multiple answers. 

The True or False questions are better in driving home the point.","SP301.csv"
