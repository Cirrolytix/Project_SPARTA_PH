What probably changed within me is my view on Data,  that Data's on their raw form is not very useful. It needs to be mined and extracted in such a way that it becomes useful for the right people. Hence I changed my way of reporting to my Supervisor.  Showing him what I think is the right visualization/presentation (my own choice). Trend shows the team performance for the past months. I was able to present it in such way that he began to think why on this particular month the teams performance is week. I backed him up because we are aware of the issue. Now what I am pushing forward is what can we do to optimize the teams performance. 

Insights when backed up by a data with value becomes so impactful that you have no way to ignore it. And it does not stop from there as I was forced to evaluate if I need to calibrate my way of thinking almost every time I finish my reports and assessment. It was both rewarding and challenging. I am very happy that I was able to continue my first course. I am truly grateful of this chance to upskill.

I became immersed in making my report in such way that the I need to choose the right visualization method (my own choice) to present the trend of accomplishment of the teams handling the projects which I monitor. I was able to present my first report to my supervisor and showed him performance of the team which resulted in him thinking why the team has a weak performance on this particular month to which I agree as we both know the issue. 

We cannot ignore the impact of the insight derived from an integrated data and not act upon it.

It also pose as challenge as you cannot stop after the report is done, it is a cycle of improving a process and think of a way to optimize it.

When people watch course videos, the engagement is very passive and they may not absorb all of the concepts being told.

Thus, I think that the course would have been better if it were entirely in text paragraphs. People can better remember what they read, and it would also allow them to be slow and careful with the material. Though a transcript is provided, it is formatted line-by-line instead of by paragraphs or bullet points, so it becomes less effective for reading purposes.

Since analytics inform us towards better decision-making, analytics happen in all facets of life.","The subject-matter expert or writers for this course must write the learning materials as if their target audience is second-year high school students or below. For example, I've seen too many adverbs and jargon. We must show, not tell. As an educator, we must not get caught up by what we know if others can't understand abstract concepts. So, it's good to use concrete words when we explain. 

Also, when we teach, it must be narrative. That way, learners hook up with what we're trying to point out. Analytics people are good storytellers. We will be better with storytelling in time. ",SP101.csv

While a real life scenario questions are hard to formulate but are needed in this course but it shouldn't delay the learning of the students (I mean we could only contact after a week). 

Remember that most of the students here are professional and allotting their rest time to complete this. If in case, the student just took a leave to study the modules, there's a hard stop that would happen for the peer reviews. 

I think instead of having an essay, a case study is more appropriate with selection or a fill in the blanks with specific answer rather than wait for someone to pick up their answer.

I do understand that this is a new innovation to educating people especially those people who cannot attend physical classes but the ""peer rating"" has its own downside. As I have evaluated other peers, I have been very serious and even do more research about the question prior to reviewing their essays. I reviewed 2 students who basically copied their answers from the internet, word per word. I wonder how would they evaluate other student's essay. My essay was also evaluated and only 1 out of the 3 reviews were helpful. 1 peer just copied and pasted the description on the radio button he ticked as his review. The other peer gave a review like focus, nice, very clear and very organized. Though this may sound good, but this was not very helpful compared to that peered who gave honest review why my essay was good and how I could improve it. ",SP101.csv

Just recently, I went to an institution where their goal is to help kids from 1 yr old up to the age of 25. I was lucky enough to talk to a 2nd year college students, studying in TUP, majoring in Computer Science and Math. I found out that his interest lies on the field of Data Analytics. Pardon me, but I used whatever I learned from this course and discuss it to him. I started with the Data Value Chain, then discuss to him the Analytics job families. In all honesty, if I didn't sign up in this course, I might be giving him the wrong information on analytics. Bottom line, I was able to piqued his interest and I can honestly say that he learned something from me, all thanks to this course. So, if we're talking of ""particularly rewarding""? This is a classic example of a ""reward"" made in heaven.","I like the delivery, and if we look for improvement?
