It?s not always an exact prediction, and likelihood of forecasts can vary wildly?especially when dealing with the commonly fluctuating variables in time series data as well as factors outside our control. With the insights gained  from forecasted data, we may be able to use them to make observations and drive future strategic decision-making to be able to achieve organizations goals.","I can't think of anything to enhance the delivery of the course since it is already informative and I like the weekly exercises/exam where we can apply what we have learned so far.","SP1003.csv"
