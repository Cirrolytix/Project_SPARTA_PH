These happened to completely different courses but I feel like it applies to any course.

An example is, avoid using screenshots when asking students to compute something in excel, just give them a spreadsheet, not let them encode it all manually. Less prone to errors that way. (this was observed in a final exam). 

Or if the course lacks graded evaluations and has the final capstone as their only form of official evaluation, maybe not make it something so subjective as peer evaluation and lean towards a more objective way of evaluation.  ","SP1006.csv"
