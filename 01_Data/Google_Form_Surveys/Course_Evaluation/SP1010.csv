To provide information to the citizens, Government websites with information on policies and programs, laws and regulations, budgets, and other issues of public interest. This aims to quickly and easily provide access to information and services to individuals. 
Consultation. This is where the Governments offer online consultation mechanism and tools, which present citizens with choices about public policy topics and encouragement to contribute. This helps the government to improve its  citizen-centered decision and policy-making.
Participation. This intends the Government to incorporate citizens into decision-making processes, generally through participatory budgeting. They provide online participation platforms where citizens can propose, discuss, give feedback, and vote for initiatives aimed to solve or improve a wide range of situations and problems in different aspects of a city.
