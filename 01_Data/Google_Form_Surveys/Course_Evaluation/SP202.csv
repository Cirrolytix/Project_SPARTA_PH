The learners have to try to figure out which and which and what is what just to have a little bit of understanding on what the speaker is talking about. Its hard to follow and doesnt give more examples. It will give the learner on what to focus on their study but this course isn't gonna cut it.

Review and improve the gamified exercises (Let's Recall). Although the exit assessment questions  are well-made, the exercise questions are bad. The exercise questions seem to have been randomly picked from the course materials, leaving behind the context. The exercises (Let's Recall) are hard to answer because the context is left out. Compare this with the assessment questions that properly lays down the context of the question.

2. Use the laser pointer when showing a slide with lots of information. Many of the slides are rich in information. The down-side to this is that when the speaker starts talking about a part of the slide, the listener can easily get lost trying to find the item the speaker is talking about.
