1. Definition of terms of some technical word used in the course.
2.Compilation of images used in the video. Some images have small font size and color gray similar to color of background of slide which make it difficult to read even in full screen mode.
 3. It will be helpful to cite some practical example of the end-data product to have better understanding of the concept. ( ex. predictive service)
4. I suggest that course is recommended to take after course with basic coding. SP102 as code after SP101 is quite confusing. The course is more technical in approach which overwhelm me in technicalities in coding. It might be better has has higher SP code maybe after basic python.
5. I hope there is alternative software to use to do the exit assessment other than GCP (PS: when in rate the course I'm still waiting for the reply in my question, maybe in future there will be answer in this suggestion.)
6. Week 1 transcription is not working, it might be error in the system or error in my end. (PS: I'm sure the coursebank will solved this in the future).","SP102.csv"

I have finished five courses here in Project SPARTA and I am very thankful for all the hard work of your team. Unfortunately, this course has a lot of issues. 

First, the lecture videos are lacking in detail. If the audience are expected to be beginners in data science, the speed and depth in which the topics will be handled should consider this. The lecture videos jump from topic to topic without a clear discussion of the lesson. Steps were quickly listed without any step-by-step guidance. Considering that we are learning a new service (i.e. GCP), the material should?ve been more friendly to those without a background on this. Even if you carefully follow the provided steps, it would lead to an error in GCP because of the lack of clarity in the lecture video. Although one might argue that we should do our own self-study outside of the course, the counterargument is that there should be at least some guidance on extra resources or a screen recording on how to do it. For example, my experience in SP201 and SP401 was helpful since I was shown either a screen recording of how to do the excel functions or a Youtube video on how to do the corporate dashboard report. With a complex service such as GCP, it is more so expected that the course will have a detailed guide. 

Second, the assessment had problems with validity. Besides the problems with the answer key, it wasn?t helpful in assessing the learning objectives. In my other courses (e.g. SP201, SP401, SP501), the assessment really tested our skills through a task that prompted us to apply our learning. I really appreciated those assignments, despite the difficulty, because I knew that I was really honing a skill that I can bring back to my work and research. Unfortunately, in this case, it appears that the assessment was given for the sake of having an assessment. 

Lastly, I noticed that the content of the video and the assessment needs updating. Comparing the GCP content in the video and the current GCP content on the web, there are differences that should also be reflected in the assessment. 
I am interested in learning about data science. I spend my weekends studying and doing my tasks because I see value in this government initiative. Unfortunately, one can?t help but be saddened if the potential of the course is wasted on poorly prepared materials. ","SP102.csv"

1. Base the exit assessments on the discussions because some questions were not even discussed and we need to research about it instead of learning from the SME. New words just pop up in some assessments.
2. When discussing about codes, it is better to have a screen recording and walking us through every step than just merely saying what is in the screenshot in the slides.
3. Provide a code resource after each coding session because most of the screenshots were blurred and cannot be read.
