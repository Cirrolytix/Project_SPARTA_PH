Through these activities, I am able to apply what I learned from the course.","There are a lot of peer graded assessments for this course. Although very helpful especially in testing and retaining the knowledge acquired, these assessments take time. Personally, I was intimidated at first and I took a long time to finish the course. Perhaps there is a way to reduce these especially on week one.

Also, I hope the instructions will be clearer so that all of us are on the same page to avoid unintentionally rating our peers unfairly.","SP401.csv"
