It took around 4-6 weeks to get a grade for each assessment, even as I attempted to give the maximum possible number of assessments (around 12-16) to try and reduce the peer grading backlog. Please consider opening assessments so that students can proceed to the next week's assessment without having to wait for a grade from their previous week's assessment.

Video lectures are difficult to understand, especially for beginners. Most videos seem to be inadequate summaries of corresponding sections of the ""Deep Learning with Python"" by Fran?ois Chollet and are extremely difficult to learn from without consulting the source material. The videos should be recreated with more thorough explanation.

Assessments also involve only slight tweaks to the sample codes presented in lecture, so perhaps it would be better to include prompts that encourage exploration (e.g. have students try to identify why particular metrics change when varying specific hyperparameters).","SP902.csv"
