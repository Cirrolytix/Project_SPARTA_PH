1. Topics. Although I had previous machine learning courses before, personally, I am still challenged with following the discussion per video. The topics seem to be compressed into couple of videos and they are highly technical, with less application/demonstration in Python. 

2. Library. The course used mglearn package a lot. mglearn is a helper package that is used for the book ""Introduction to Machine Learning with Python"". I don't think that this is practical because I think we would be using mostly sklearn in field. Although it's helpful in the sense of discussing the concepts, but I think we should have focused on using sklearn.

3. Applicability. As mentioned in item 1, many topics are highly technical. This is okay, but we should have had a live demo (similar to Data Engineering using SQL), and focusing on sklearn. This is would boost further confidence on coding in Python. I codes were presented without going through the steps, which would really be challenging, especially, the library which was highly used is not a common package. I think that we should have built the habit for the learners to rely on sklearn.","SP901.csv"

For example, the sql and python courses in the data scientist pathway here had a more beginner friendly approach through detailed discussion of the why that code was there in the first place.

- Please have a pre-requisite before taking the course. I'm an advanced beginner in coding (python) and haven't done machine learning before. So i was excited about this course as i thought it will guide me. Unfortunately, this is for mid to advanced skilled students not for beginners. I'm very disappointed that it's not really well explained (compared to the previous class I took). It almost discourage me from completing the course - but i need to cos I'm a Sparta scholar. 
- I know machine learning is difficult. I hope the team behind this course consult a beginner (or someone with 0 idea about machine learning) so they were able to make appropriate content that is for beginner. It's always possible to divide this course into two if one course isn't enough to fully grasp the topic.

Overall, this is not for beginner. ","SP901.csv"

For example, with Logistic Regression, it would also be useful to show how to see the summary results down to interpretation and practical application. Additional info (e.g., for LOGIT - why use scikit vs statsmodels) would also be greatly appreciated.","SP901.csv"
