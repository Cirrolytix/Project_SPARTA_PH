In fact, this course is the worst course I've taken in my entire life. The speakers are just reading what was in the slide and no further information was given. I suggest you just gave the learners a handout or something and we will read it on our own. This course will never fail to disappoint learners, especially those who don't have background in Statistics. ","1) We will appreciate it more if this course have better visual aids. I mean, yes there is a part in the lecture which narrates how to do ANOVA in Excel. My question is, why narrate it if you can demonstrate (via video) how to do it? Also, images and plots are so small and blurred that axes labels are almost unreadable.

2) Maybe you can elaborate more on other topics. We've seen a lot of plots, but it was not discussed how to construct them and how to use them. In this course, they are given to learners as constructed plots, without teaching the learners how to construct them, and most importantly, how to interpret them. For example, how do we know when to say that a residual plot is ""well-behaved?"" I'm not well-versed in Statistics so the ""well-behaved"" and ""not well-behaved"" residual plots both looks chaotic to me. Maybe you should have given us some pointers or guidelines how to interpret these graphs?

3) I truly believe that the guest speakers of this course are knowledgeable in Statistics. I hope they will use their knowledge in demonstrating examples (real world examples) instead of just reading what was written in the slides. I actually finished some video presentation WITHOUT playing the video. I just read the transcript on the side because THE CONTENT OF THE VIDEO AND THE TRANSCRIPT ARE THE SAME. Sometimes illustrations/graphs are provided but due to the quality of the illustration, ITS ALMOST USELESS.

4) I hope the team will create a prerequisite for this course maybe? I think this is the first course in Statistical Analysis here  but Oh boy, the lectures looked like it treated us like learners with Master's degree in Statistics, continuously giving out technical words which I heard here for the first time in my entire life, and no explanation or whatsoever was given to even define what does those technical statistical terms mean.","SP602.csv"

Understanding the concept and purpose of Experimental Design. Experimental design  means creating a set of procedures to test a hypothesis and laying out a detailed experimental plan in advance of doing the experiment to obtain data that can be analyze to yield valid and objective conclusions. It is the most familiar type of research design in the field of science and some other fields and industries. A well-chosen experimental designs can maximize the amount of information that can be obtain for a given amount of experimental effort.","Lesson is great and delivery, for me is already enhanced.

For example, most problems were solved using Excel and the assessments ask us to solve manually.
2. When talking about using Excel, the dataset can be provided to us so that we can follow while the SMEs are discussing. Also, demonstration is better than just telling what to do and what was done.
3. More of graphs and less of text so that we can understand it more because too much texts in a slide lowers the excitement to learn.
4. Better if the SMEs can be seen while discussing. There are some parts in the presentation that has low volume and the exponents are not properly written.
5. Week 2 onwards starts with introduction as a reading followed by an example as a video. I think that it is better if the introduction is also in a form of a video so that the establishment of knowledge in the participants is the same.","SP602.csv"
