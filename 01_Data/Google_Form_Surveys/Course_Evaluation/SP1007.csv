It is important in managing public finances of the economy. PFM encompasses the seven areas budgeting, accounting, auditing, revenue generation, cash management, debt management and public reporting on public sector financial operations. The elements of Good and Effective budgeting are; Aggregate fiscal discipline or spending within means, it is controlling the level of spending. Allocative efficiency or spending on the right priorities, it is spending on the right things and setting priorities straight. Technical efficiency or spending with measurable results, is spending at the right cost and producing more with less cost. Budget Preparation input requires budget call and budget priorities, the process are formulation of FEs, citizen engagement, program convergence budgeting, tier 2 agency proposal, budget hearings and review, presentation to the president and consolidation, validation, confirmation. The output should be the President's Budget. Budget Legislation input requires the President's budget. The process are home deliberations, senate deliberations, bicameral deliberations, ratification and enrolment, and enactment. The output of this is the General Appropriations Acts (GAA) or the People's budget. Budget execution includes, early procurement activities, budget programming, allotment release, obligation, issuance of notice of cash allocation and disbursement. The implementation are being monitored and evaluated during budget accountability. It includes performance targets, accountability reports, public disclosures, performance review, publication of mid-year and year-end reports and audit.

In week 2, I learned that budget allocations are further classified as to sector, expense class, regions, recipient unit, special purpose funds, and appropriation source. The allocation of the national government budget for major sector includes social services, economic services, general public services, debt burden and defense. Budget dimensions by expense class includes Personnel services(PS), maintenance and other operating expenses (MOOE), capital outlays (CO), and financial expenditures (FinEx). I also learned that budget can also be classified according to the appropriation source.

In week 3, I learned about the sources of the government?s revenues ? tax and non-tax revenues. The major classes of tax revenue are taxes on income and profits, taxes on property, taxes on domestic goods and services, taxes on international trade and transactions and other sources. Non tax revenues are Bureau of the treasury (BTr) income, privatization, fees and charges, and other sources. Other sources of revenue are income tax, estate and donor's taxes, value added tax, other percentage taxes, excise taxes, documentary stamp taxes and other taxes. Reforming the tax system is important for it promotes investment, create jobs and reduce poverty. Some features of the CTRP are TRAIN Law, tax amnesty, sin taxes. 
 
In week 4, I learned the importance of government borrowings and debt service. Government borrows money to spend on the welfare of their people, to   support services programs and projects. Especially when the country facing a challenge like this pandemic, it is important to meet the needs of the people for their safety and security. To finance national government deficits, to obtain foreign exchange, to secure financing at more favorable terms than the opportunity cost of revenues, to take advantage of benefits attached to the funds and to balance the timing of resources with the project gestation and repayment of benefit.

MAYBE the team can review if a support staff or SME should probably interact in the discussion forum, especially in the case studies (just like in other courses) because I observed that learners tend to have different understanding of how questions are answered.
