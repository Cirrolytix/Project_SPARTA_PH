Discussions tend to gloss over important details and are generally too quick for me to understand the concept being taught. Not enough time was given to expound on how certain Keras features can be implemented or how students can avoid common pitfalls when implementing them.

Some students also reported confusing instructions for the assessments, although most were resolved before I even joined the course. The Week 4 quiz also contained several items (such as questions on computational graphs and sessions) that were never discussed during the course or even covered by the reference material.","The slides used by the SME were at least thorough enough to include sample code with commentary. The provided readings were also reasonably thorough.","Expound on the lectures. Even if each video would become longer and the course would have to contain more readings, additional discussion is required so that the videos can also cover implemention tips and tricks and some theory regarding the Keras/TensorFlow features being used.

It would also be interesting to see more modern Keras/TensorFlow features in the lectures, especially as deep learning is a rapidly evolving field.","SP902.csv"
