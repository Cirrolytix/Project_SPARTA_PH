Please see comment below.","The speaker made an effort to share tips in getting started with GCP. ","Personally, I love to learn and I value this opportunity given to us. I have finished five courses here in Project SPARTA and I am very thankful for all the hard work of your team. Unfortunately, this course has a lot of issues. 

First, the lecture videos are lacking in detail. If the audience are expected to be beginners in data science, the speed and depth in which the topics will be handled should consider this. The lecture videos jump from topic to topic without a clear discussion of the lesson. Steps were quickly listed without any step-by-step guidance. Considering that we are learning a new service (i.e. GCP), the material should?ve been more friendly to those without a background on this. Even if you carefully follow the provided steps, it would lead to an error in GCP because of the lack of clarity in the lecture video. Although one might argue that we should do our own self-study outside of the course, the counterargument is that there should be at least some guidance on extra resources or a screen recording on how to do it. For example, my experience in SP201 and SP401 was helpful since I was shown either a screen recording of how to do the excel functions or a Youtube video on how to do the corporate dashboard report. With a complex service such as GCP, it is more so expected that the course will have a detailed guide. 

Second, the assessment had problems with validity. Besides the problems with the answer key, it wasn?t helpful in assessing the learning objectives. In my other courses (e.g. SP201, SP401, SP501), the assessment really tested our skills through a task that prompted us to apply our learning. I really appreciated those assignments, despite the difficulty, because I knew that I was really honing a skill that I can bring back to my work and research. Unfortunately, in this case, it appears that the assessment was given for the sake of having an assessment. 

Lastly, I noticed that the content of the video and the assessment needs updating. Comparing the GCP content in the video and the current GCP content on the web, there are differences that should also be reflected in the assessment. 

I am interested in learning about data science. I spend my weekends studying and doing my tasks because I see value in this government initiative. Unfortunately, one can?t help but be saddened if the potential of the course is wasted on poorly prepared materials. ","SP102.csv"
