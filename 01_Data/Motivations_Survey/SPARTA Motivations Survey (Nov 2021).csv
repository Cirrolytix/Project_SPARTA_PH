The course content in Project SPARTA scholarship is more practical and useful. The mentor really tries his best to teach the subject matters in such a way that we, the learners would comprehend the course content more easily. Now, upon having a learning experience in Project SPARTA scholarship, I must say that the course content and instruction approaches are really insightful, and highly informative. ","Yes","No","I am finalizing my answer since there is a passing score. I do not want to retake the item. I want to excel in my chosen pathways. My aim for excellence usually causes me to take longer time in finishing the tasks since I really have to think more critically and analytically. Another reason is that I am a graduating student who does a lot of academic, and organizational tasks since I am a class president, and organizational officer in our University. These also cause me to somehow split my time in finishing my pathway. But, now, I was able to answer my exit assessment on a certain pathway. I am just waiting for my peers' grades, and comments in my answer. ","Yes","Actually, I still have my scholarship. My scholarship was already reactivated. I am just worried that if I answer no, you would remove my scholarship. ","","I would like to address why the email of Coursebank is always placed in promotions? I humbly hope that the IT experts or analytics team of Coursebank will fix it. Because not all people or scholarship grantees have enough time in checking their promotion email inbox more especially when there are so many emails. Thank you so much. "

It's just that the platform, coursebank, could use some improvements. I believe I also provided them feedback this year before I became busy with my work project, but I wasn't able to check yet if they were able to implement it. My suggestions for the platform are: (1) fix the speed adjustment feature in their videos (e.g. 2x speed or 0.5 speed) as well as (2) remove the 1 day delay before you can resubmit incorrect items in a quiz/seatwork. If there's really a need to penalize guessing, then the number of retries could be reduced, similar to coursera or edX (e.g. n-1 tries for n number of choices). The reason for this is because I usually allocate a specific day and time of the week to go through courses, so I was hoping to learn as much as I can in that particular timeframe, rather than wait until when I am free again to finish a prerequisite quiz/seatwork just to be able to proceed with other quizzes/materials."
