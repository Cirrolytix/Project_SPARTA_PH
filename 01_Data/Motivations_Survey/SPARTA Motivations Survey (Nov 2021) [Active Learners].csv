We already have machine learning and deep learning courses in Python, but the Computing in Python course is still unavailable. This results to lack of enrollees in the advanced courses, which affects peer-graded work.

(2) I have high expectations to some courses, but the content didn't satisfy them. For example, SP901 and SP902 are great courses, but the content is really challenging because the pace of the instructor is quite fast considering that he discussed some highly technical concepts. Some courses, like SP602, is purely conceptual with less applications.

(3) I think the course can be further structured and organized better. Perhaps, we can label some courses by skill, such as Excel, statistics, Python, SQL, etc."

Please lay a comfortable ground for begginers and only give them the hard stuff when you think they have enough to want to stay and learn like when a person who lived a good life in his hometown so when colonizers come he notices that those people are threats to the life he had. To retaliate, he tried his best even giving his life to protect it. That sort of thing.  Too much words on visual aid kind of beats the purpose. If those are really needed, a downloadable pdf of the subject would be ideal. And also make practice quizes where people can test their knowledge without having to send a letter and wait days to repeat. No pressure to you but those are my suggestions to make it better."

It kills momentum, for instance the enrollment codes takes months for us scholar to activate, I know that this project is free but we already invested time an effort on this so I would expect that the admin would address such concerns accordingly and timely. I do appreciate that there's a turnaround for this (manual enrollment) but this still takes up time to request and a number of follow-ups. Currently I already finished the Associate pathway and still waiting to be enrolled in Analytics Manager pathway. Hoping for a positive resolution. Thanks."

Here are my feedback to help improve project SPARTA:


1. SPARTA must hire additional manpower to do tasks, such as replying to queries/ concerns by participants immediately. 

2. SPARTA must develop a ""room"" (similar to google classroom) wherein students from partner university (ex. BulSU) are segregated with other scholars who are not from BulSU. Scholars that go in the same university need a room just for them and separate from the others, for example, if scholar A  and B both answer the exit assessment (essay) and the scholar B (from BulSU - and have a timeframe to follow) will wait longer and scholar B will be late from the timeframe of the school and it will cause stress because some peers didn't immediately assess the essay of others (and understandable on their part that the course must be taken for 5 weeks) however, there are different cases of scholars too. 

3. Lastly, essay exit assessments must be checked by SPARTA itself and not by peers, because I already experience sabotaged when peers checked my answers. I did my best for that and some of them said ""It didn't answer the question"" but in fact I did answer the question, some didn't give constructive comments and just throw whatever words that came in their heads. I don't't understand the standards of some assessors it's frustrating."

Some are already outdated. Like in Google cloud, the dashboard shown in the videos does not correspond on how the dashboard looks now. Also, make it more engaging, and do not assume that the learners already know the topic. I feel like there are missing points in the lessons. There are files used in some of the videos which I don't understand where did the narrator get it! Or when the narrator said to create a CSV, but from where? I know how to make a csv in excel but it is not how it looks in the video, where did he create the csv to make it look like a code??? There are so many gaps in the lessons. It needs improvements. Lessons should be made in such way that even those with zero knowledge will understand. It should be detailed, specially that what we are learning are skills."

The message/forum board is not a place to upload your work and ask for guidance. That is why in all my subjects in sparta, I always ended unable to complete the last phase of the module which is the capstone. Also, when I check works of others, I do not know which one followed the instructions correctly.

Also, when the subjects that I'm enrolled expired, when I ask for extension using the link provided, no one gets back to me on the status. So I do not know if I should continue with my other subjects or not.

Checking others work to be able to continue sometimes take a week or two. It is also a reason that I lose momentum as I was dedicating time for it but checking others work is a challenge as well as receiving grade for my work will also take a week or two. So instead me finishing everything at my own pace, I have to wait and end up not doing the next part after a month. Because two weeks is a long time for a peer to assess my work."

It seems that I can't finish Dashboards and Drill-Down Analytics because I don't quite understand the lessons. Hoping that I can finish Data Associate Pathway with a certificate of completion with 5 courses even without Dashboards and Drill-Down Analytics. As of now, I finish 4 courses and I'm waiting for 1 course which is SQL for Business Users. Hope you understand. Thank you and God bless."

For the SPARTA Team's end, you might also monitor/survey the courses they are stuck and offer additional notes/guides for them to understand the topics well and finish the course."

I suddenly lose track of interest when i was stuck in excel. ,  In without constant reminders like e-mails i literally forgets that I am enrolled n a free DOST Scholarship. Hope i could still have a chance to continue. One of my suggestion is to have a native sparta or cousebank app so that we could use our mobile to continue learning while on-the-go"

There is also the requirement of peer grading others. I think this is a bad idea because some students may drop out that eventually other students will be left hanging with their assignments not being reviewed.

I hope there are some changes to these requirements."

The speakers obviously staged the presentation. They are obviously reading something or memorized their lines. The recording so boring. Compared to what  I have seen in other lecture sites, the speakers in SPARTA are not encouraging, they will just talk and record, I cannot feel their interest to pass the information to their viewers and absorb it. They are as if robots talking what are programmed to do. No movements. No example. The camera angle is the only one moving. I think you need to modify all the vidoes and  make it more engaging. Like as if they are talking to the live viewers. As I think most of your viewers are Filipino, Why not make it Fil-English approach. Yes, english is business language, the way your speakers deliver the lectures in english is not engaging. They just talk, they have no emotions. They have no feelings. They are spkeaking english, but you can feel that they are not comfortable. They are not interacting with the learners. They are are wayyyyyy tooooo technical. I wasn't able to finish the course I enrolled with.  Why? cos every time I watch the course I feel sleepy. I got bored watching the robot-like speakers. I finished a lot of courses in other sites. Local and International all of them are engaging, I can feel that the speaker wants the viewers to  learn. Unlike in SPARTA, robot-like speakers. Even their voices, I have heard a lecture that I though he is hiding somewhere, his voice is like he is whispering over the microphone when doing the excel demo. I felt sleepy so I stopped watching. I decided not to finish the course coz I dont want to see another robot-like speaker and not interested to transfer the knowledge to their viewers. They are not teachers. They are technical people who are asked to make a video and get paid. Make the videos more engaging, make more examples, make the speaker talk in their natural way. Digital hand writing is good presentation. Thank you.  "
